class="block"><h2 id=hawaii-business-formation-options>Hawaii Business Formation Options:</h2><h3 id=1-sole-proprietorship>1. Sole Proprietorship.</h3><p>A Sole Proprietorship is the simplest business structure and the least expensive to start. The business is owned and operated by one individual, who is personally liable for all business debts.</p><h3 id=2-corporation>2. Corporation.</h3><p>A Corporation is a formal business structure owned by one or more shareholders, which makes it easier to raise capital. In Hawaii, the shareholders' liability is limited to the amount they invest in the company. Corporations are typically more difficult and expensive to start. They are divided into S-Corporations and C-Corporations.</p><h3 id=3-limited-liability-company>3. Limited Liability Company.</h3><p>A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is the most common business structure. It separates the owner/s and the company from a business and liability perspective. An LLC is the best option for a small business as it is flexible, easy to set up, and requires minimal paperwork.</p><h3 id=4-general-partnership>4. General Partnership.</h3><p>A General Partnership is run by two or more partners who manage the day-to-day business operations and are personally liable for all of the company's debts. This is the simplest form of a partnership with minimal paperwork.</p><h3 id=5-limited-partnership>5. Limited Partnership.</h3><p>A Limited Partnership (LP) is similar to a General Partnership except that limited partners do not manage the business and are only liable for the amount they invest in the company.</p><h3 id=6-limited-liability-partnership>6. Limited Liability Partnership.</h3><p>A Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is similar to a General Partnership but each partner is protected from other partners' debts and obligations.</p><h3 id=7-nonprofit-corporation>7. Nonprofit Corporation.</h3><p>A nonprofit corporation has no owners. Instead, it is governed by a board of directors. Nonprofit corporations are funded by grants, public donations, and fees for services. All funds are retained by the organization for the advancement of a social cause.</p><h3 id=8-cooperative>8. Cooperative.</h3><p>A cooperative is owned and managed by the workers of a business. The members share the decision-making and profits of the business. The benefits of this type of business structure are that it provides better wages, offers extensive training for employees, as well as opportunities for participation in management.</p><h3 id=9-corporation-sole>9. Corporation Sole.</h3><p>A corporation sole is a nonprofit organization operated by a chief priest, presiding elder, or other presiding officer of any church for the purposes of administering and managing the affairs, property, and revenues of a church.</p><h3 id=10-sustainable-business-corporation>10. Sustainable Business Corporation.</h3><p>Also known as a benefit corporation, sustainable business corporations are run by one or more owners/shareholders and have a board of directors. This type of business structure differs from regular corporations in that they consider their impact on the environment and society in addition to seeking profit. Shareholders have limited liability for the debts of the business.</p></div></div></div></div><div
