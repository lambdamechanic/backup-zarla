Each type of hair salon offers a different range of services and attracts different customers.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Basic value-based hair salon:</strong> Basic value-based hair salons offer few services, focusing mostly on haircuts. These types of hair salons are usually franchises or chains, and they accept walk-in appointments. Their haircuts are reasonably priced and the stylists work quickly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Boutique hair salon:</strong> Boutique hair salons are a mix between a hair salon and a retail store. They offer the usual hair salon services, but also sell items such as books, jewelry, clothing, candles, etc. Boutique salons generally cater to women.</p></li><li><p><strong>Salon and spa:</strong> A salon and spa offer hair services along with full pampering experiences. They are often high-end and expensive, and some even have liquor licenses.</p></li><li><p><strong>Specialty hair salon:</strong> Specialty hair salons rely on specialist stylists to offer clients services that require advanced techniques. Often, these salons employ only a few stylists, each a master in one particular area.</p></li><li><p><strong>Barbershop:</strong> A barbershop mainly caters to men, offering simple cuts and styles, and various grooming services. The decor is mostly simple and most barbers are men.</p></li></ul></div></div><div
