The contribution margin is the money generated for each child under your care after subtracting the variable prices of the business's costs. Ultimately, it will help you to determine tuition prices, what kind of discounts you can offer, and what it costs to take care of multiple children.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Establish your unit sales price. This is the price you'll charge for one child on a weekly, monthly, or yearly basis.</p><p> According to the National Association of Child Care Resource &amp; Referral Agencies (NACCRRA), daycare services for <strong>babies and toddlers</strong> average between $300.00 to $1,564.00 a month and <strong>preschoolers</strong> average between $371.00 to $1,100.00 a month. While <strong>in-home care</strong> averages between $300.00 to $995.00 a month.</p><p>For this example, let's assume you charge <strong>$350.00</strong> per month for one child at your daycare center.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Calculate your variable cost or your expenses for taking care of one child. This is the additional costs for food, supplies, arts and craft materials, and in some cases, insurance. This will heavily depend on your type of business and your service agreement.</p><p>To make it simpler, let's only calculate the variable cost for a month of daycare. For this example, let's say it cost <strong>$120.00</strong> a month per child for all expenses.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Subtract the variable costs from your unit sales price.</p><p><strong>$350.00 - $120.00 = $230.00</strong></p><p>$230.00 is your contribution margin for your daycare business.</p></div></div></div><div
