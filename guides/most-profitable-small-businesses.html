Accounting and tax preparation.</h3><p>Businesses that offer accounting and tax-related services continue to be among those with the best bottom lines. The U.S. accounting services industry is the largest by region in a global market projected to be worth more than <a
href="https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2021/03/15/2192795/28124/en/Outlook-on-the-Accounting-Services-Global-Market-to-2030-Identify-Growth-Segments-for-Investment.html">$700 billion in 2025</a> — the future looks bright for accountants.</p><h3 id=2-app-development>2. App development.</h3><p>With the app development market <a
href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/app/united-states">expected to grow by 10%</a> over the coming years, creating a useful app can produce rewarding results. However, while app development is thriving in the market, it requires expert knowledge of coding and the app's subject matter. But with a winning idea, you can sell the app to other companies or launch it yourself.</p><h3 id=3-digital-marketing>3. Digital marketing.</h3><p>In an increasingly digital-driven world, digital marketing presents a key touchpoint between businesses and customers and is an essential feature of any business's online presence. As such, specialized fields, including web design, copywriting, and graphic design, continue to be in high demand and can be very profitable business ventures.</p><h3 id=4-catering>4. Catering.</h3><p>Operating a successful catering business is hard work and requires careful planning, along with the ability to deliver on expectations. However, if you have what it takes to be a chef, event planner, business manager, and customer service sensation all rolled into one, there is potential to turn a healthy profit.</p><h3 id=5-cleaning-services>5. Cleaning services.</h3><p>Starting a cleaning service can be a profitable venture, with the professional cleaning service market <a
href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210104005392/en/Unites-States-Professional-Cleaning-Services-Market-2021-to-2026---Industry-Outlook-and-Forecast---ResearchAndMarkets.com">forecasted to grow by 6% annually by 2026</a>. Since business owners can manage the service from any location and the equipment needed for the job is relatively affordable, it's a more favorable market to enter.</p><h3 id=6-food-truck>6. Food truck.</h3><p>The food truck market in the U.S. experienced a <a
href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/food-trucks-industry/">burgeoning revival</a> in recent years. With a flourishing foodie culture in a strained economy, offering affordable gourmet food on the move can be a profitable business model that offers more flexibility than a traditional restaurant.</p><h3 id=7-delivery-services>7. Delivery services.</h3><p>Increased demand for courier and local delivery services has seen businesses in this industry turn a solid profit, and between 2022 and 2027, the U.S. market is predicted to <a
href="https://www.technavio.com/report/courier-and-local-delivery-services-market-in-us-industry-size-analysis">increase by $27.93 million</a>. While the market has seen an influx of customers interested in the service, it remains competitive, with many large-scale businesses leading the way.</p><h3 id=8-management-consulting>8. Management consulting.</h3><p>While the management consulting market in the U.S. took a knock in 2020, it made a fast comeback and has already <a
href="https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/management-consulting-united-states/">surpassed its pre-Covid market size</a>. With digital transformation still being a key challenge for many companies, management consulting firms that leverage technology and automation are in a prime position to secure a profitable future.</p><h3 id=9-social-media-influencer>9. Social media influencer.</h3><p>If you are the type of person who has extensive experience or knowledge about a particular industry, topic, or culture, it may be worth your while to become a social media influencer. No formal education or qualification is needed, just a talent for engaging with an audience and most importantly, creating informative and entertaining content.</p><p>Social media influencers earn income from advertising brands and the more followers an influencer has, the more brand awareness they can influence. Starting small, a steady rise in followers can lead to significant income.</p><h3 id=10-content-creation>10.  Content creation.</h3><p>With just a laptop and a good internet connection, content creation can be a lucrative field to enter. Thanks to more and more businesses adapting to digital trends, companies are looking toward influencers and content creators to help boost their digital presence, and the job only requires a social media-savvy individual who can spot trends.</p><p>Whether you specialize in blogs, website content, advertising, or even e-books, there is a significant demand for content producers who can provide interesting and well-planned content.</p><h3 id=11-personal-trainer>11. Personal trainer.</h3><p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics' <a
href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/personal-care-and-service/fitness-trainers-and-instructors.htm">projections for fitness trainers and instructors</a> are positive, predicting a growth rate of 14% within the next decade. While those embarking on a career as a personal trainer may start out working at large fitness centers, experienced, certified personal trainers can make a lot more money working for themselves.</p><h3 id=12-virtual-assistant-services>12. Virtual assistant services.</h3><p>The demand for virtual assistants will continue to increase with the rise of remote-based companies and interactive technologies that automate routine tasks. It's predicted that the virtual assistant market will grow to <a
href="https://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/virtual-assistant-market-2023-global-industry-trends-share-size-growth-demand-and-supply-opportunity-and-forecast-by-2025">over $4 billion between 2023 and 2025</a>, expanding at a rate of approximately 12% by the end of the period.</p><p>The position primarily requires prior administrative and customer service experience, but you can work remotely, which saves on startup costs. You can either opt to work through a virtual assistant service or start your own business, both of which provide you with flexibility and room for growth.</p><h3 id=13-online-tutoring>13. Online tutoring.</h3><p>If you specialize in a certain subject matter, online tutoring can help connect you with students or seasoned professionals wishing to broaden their expertise. With the help of innovative video calling software and a solid internet connection, you can tutor students anywhere in the world, removing the need for office space or costly equipment.</p><p>Additionally, you could opt to create online courses that cover your primary subjects and market them to businesses that require them for training or tutoring purposes.</p><h3 id=14-life-coach>14. Life coach.</h3><p>Life coaches are becoming a popular alternative to traditional psychotherapy practitioners. If you have a background in counseling or psychology and a passion for people, becoming a life coach can be a lucrative endeavor.</p><p>The life coaching industry is unregulated with no formal education or qualification needed. However, the more respected and popular life coaches complete a certification, such as those offered by the International Coaching Federation (ICF) and the National Board for Health &amp; Wellness Coaching (NBHWC).</p><h3 id=15-pet-handling-service>15. Pet-handling service.</h3><p>The <a
href="https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/pet-care-market">pet care industry is booming</a>, with pet owners looking for products and services to ensure their furry companions' health and happiness, from supplements and premium food to grooming services and accessories.
