class="block"><h2 id=tennessee-business-types>Tennessee Business Types:</h2><h3 id=1-sole-proprietorship>1. Sole Proprietorship.</h3><p>A common business structure for small businesses thanks to its simplicity. With this structure, the business is managed and owned by one individual who is solely responsible for the enterprise. In addition to paying less in taxes than corporations, the net income from the business is filed as regular income on the owner’s personal income tax return.</p><p><strong>In Tennessee, you can create a sole proprietorship without filing any legal documents.</strong> However, in order to be recognized as a sole proprietorship, you must obtain a business license, choose a business name, file a fictitious business name, obtain the necessary permits, and apply for an Employer Identification Number.</p><h3 id=2-partnership>2. Partnership.</h3><p>A suitable choice for businesses with two or more owners. Each owner will contribute towards funding, property, or labor, and in turn, receive a share in the profits and losses of the business.</p><p>In Tennessee, <strong>all partnerships must complete the applicable paperwork and file it with the Secretary of State</strong>. There are three common partnerships recognized in Tennessee. These include General Partnerships (GP), Limited Partnerships (LP), and Limited Liability Partnerships (LLP).</p><p><strong>Partnership Registration Paperwork:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>General Partnership</strong>: Statement of Partnership Authority.</p></li><li><p><strong>Limited Partnerships</strong>: Certificate of Limited Partnership.</p></li><li><p><strong>Limited Liability Partnerships (LLP)</strong>: Registration Statement.</p></li></ul><h3 id=3-limited-liability-company>3. Limited Liability Company (LLC).</h3><p>The most popular type of legal structure due to minimal paperwork, flexibility, tax benefits, and a simple implementation process. LLC business owners are not obligated to file a corporate tax return. In Tennessee, <strong>you must file an Articles of Organization with the Tennessee Secretary of State</strong>. This can be done <a
href="https://sos.tn.gov/businesses">online</a>, in person, or by mail. There is a filing fee of $300.00.</p><h3 id=4-corporation>4. Corporation.</h3><p>Corporations are standalone entities with shareholders. This means that the corporation can own assets and conduct business in its own name. Compared to a sole proprietorship or partnership, corporations are more expensive and complex to form.</p><p><strong>The process of registering a corporation in Tennessee is much more strenuous</strong> than other legal structures. You'll need to appoint a Registered Agent, establish corporate record books and bylaws, appoint initial corporate directors, issue stock, complete and file Articles of Incorporation Charter For Profit Corporation, and obtain the appropriate business licenses. There is a filing fee of $100.00.</p></div><div
