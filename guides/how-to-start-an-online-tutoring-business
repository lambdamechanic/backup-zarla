Buying a noise-canceling headset will help you to hear clear audio regardless of how noisy your environment is.</p><p><strong>You may want to invest in a camera.</strong> Most laptops come with built-in webcams, but quality can vary vastly depending on the make and age of your machine. Test out your video quality and gauge whether an external camera is needed. This may also be useful as a means to display your writing if the camera is attached to a tripod.</p><p><strong>A microphone can help to create better audio.</strong> We recommend a lapel mic if you plan to stand in front of a whiteboard and move around. If you plan to be stationary, you can use a mic that connects to your aux port and rests on your desk or attaches to the side of your screen.</p><p><strong>Using a backdrop can be functional and professional.</strong> You can find a plain sheet to hang behind you while presenting so that your lessons appear more professional. You will be able to mask the fact that you are working from home.</p></div></div><div

During the same time period, clients made 5,000 lesson purchases. First, let's find the average purchase value:</p><p>$400,000/5,000 = $80.00</p><p>This means that the average purchase value was $80.00.</p><p>During the same year, 800 clients made purchases. To find the purchase frequency rate, we can divide the number of purchases by the number of clients:</p><p>5,000/800 = 6.25</p><p>Multiply the average purchase value and the purchase frequency rate to find the client value:</p><p>$80 x 6.25 = $500.00</p><p>The average client value is $500.00.</p><p>Now, we will assume for the sake of this example that the average client lifespan is 4.5 years.</p><p>Finally, we can find the customer lifetime value by multiplying the average client value by the average client lifespan:</p><p>$500 x 4.5 = $2,250.00</p><p>Therefore, the customer lifetime value for your company is $2,250.00.</p></div></div></div></div><div
