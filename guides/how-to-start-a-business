</span><p>You can conduct market research yourself, or you can hire a consulting firm to do the research for you. Obviously, doing the work in-house will save you a lot of money. Since most people who are starting a business don't have much capital, this is the most popular option. Consulting firms are generally only brought in when the entrepreneur has readily available access to funding, or they are considering a move into a very specialized or highly competitive space.</p></div></div></div></div><div

Investors and lenders will want to know exactly where their money is going and what the prospects of a return on their investment are. Because of this, the market research that you have compiled is a key piece of the business plan.</p><p>Try your best to be both detailed and concise when you are creating your business plan. It's best to avoid technical jargon and industry terms that an outside investor might not understand. If you have to use these terms to get your point across, make sure you explain them.</p></div></div><div

You'll likely need to use a schedule C form to report profits and losses.</p></li><li><p><strong>Partnership:</strong> a business relationship between two or more people who share costs and revenues. Partnerships do not pay income tax but must file an annual return. Taxes are passed on to the individual members of the partnership.</p></li><li><p><strong>Corporation:</strong> a corporation is a standalone entity with shareholders. A corporation must file an annual tax return and is required to pay corporate taxes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Limited Liability Company (LLC):</strong> LLCs are regulated by State laws. An LLC can be owned by a person, persons, or a corporation. Depending on the size and location of the LLC, it may be treated as a partnership or corporation for tax purposes. Check your State's laws for more information.</p></li></ul><div
