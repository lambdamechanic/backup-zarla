It is usually more profitable than by-the-hour pricing, easier to adjust, and easier for the client to budget. As it focuses on results and not hours, it is easier to forecast revenue.

And that is too time-consuming and expensive, and not necessary."</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Cathy Iconis, CPA - QBOchat</p></td><td><p>"I charge a flat fee, but it is based on how much time I expect my engagement to take monthly times what I want my hourly rate to be.
