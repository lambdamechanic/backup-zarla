Furthermore, prolonged exposure to sunlight can cause issues such as dehydration and skin cancer.</p><p><strong>Gardeners can be asked to do some dangerous activities</strong>, such as pruning tall trees, working in close proximity to electrical wires, and operating dangerous equipment, such as power saws.

class="block"><h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-a-gardener-and-a-landscaper>What's the difference between a gardener and a landscaper?</h2><p>Gardening and landscaping are closely related, but there are some significant differences. Of course, there is also some cross-over of tasks.</p><p><strong>Gardeners</strong> are focused on the health and well-being of plants and will usually maintain what a landscaper has created. They mow lawns, prune plants, do weeding, and fertilize the soil. They will identify pests and diseases and apply herbicides and feeds.</p><p>A good gardener knows which plants flourish in a particular area and season and where to buy the best plants. Gardeners know all about plants and horticulture, including how they grow, how to make them last longer, and the best position in the garden. Gardeners may also work on landscaping, such as inserting irrigation systems or outdoor furniture.</p><p><strong>Landscapers</strong> often construct gardens where there were no gardens before. They will design the project and implement the construction, from putting together the plants, flowers, and other flora, to installing landscaping constructions such as pathways, decks, pergolas, and water features.</p><p><strong>Landscape architects</strong> must get a degree and pass a national examination for a license, while landscapers do not necessarily need a license or qualification and may just implement what the landscape architect has designed. Landscapers may also work to maintain the garden they have constructed.</p></div></div></div></div><div
