class="block-intro-text"><p>A food truck is a mobile vendor that serves meals, beverages, and other food products such as desserts. Some food trucks come equipped with a kitchen where food is freshly prepared, while others sell prepackaged meals. Food trucks can operate at special events like festivals or concerts, or at fixed locations depending on the business model.</p></div></div></div></div><div

Food trucks offer fewer financial risks than many small businesses and can reach broader markets than traditional brick-and-mortar eateries with static locations.</p></div><div
