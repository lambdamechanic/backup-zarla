</span><p>Generally, franchises perform better than independents. However, a <a
href="https://www.pmq.com/pizza-power-report-2023/">2023 report</a> shows that independents are making a comeback, even though they are hindered slightly by inflation in food cost, leading to a necessary hike in pizza prices, which in turn leads to a decrease in sales. Sales for independents jumped by 10.24% in 2022, while franchises saw a slight drop of 1.5% in sales between October 2020 and September 2021.</p></div><div

</span><p>Independent ownership means that all the responsibilities fall on you, from creating the menu to building a brand and a positive reputation. You will have more control over the budget and will keep all the profits, but you will carry more of the initial costs of starting up. You will also have more control over branding, menu changes, employment structure, and ambiance but, without a track record of success, it is difficult to attract investors or source start-up funding.</p></div><div

</span><p>With a franchise, a proven concept, established brand and reputation, clear marketing strategy, and business concept are all handed to you. There is often a franchising fee of up to several hundred thousand dollars, royalties and national advertising campaign fees, and proof of startup funding, but the business and menu guidelines have already been developed. However, you will have very little control over menu items and decor. Franchises do generally source financial support more easily because of their proven track records.</p></div></div></div><div
