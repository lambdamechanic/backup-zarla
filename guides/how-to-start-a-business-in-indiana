class="block block-callout primary"><h2 id=indiana-business-types>Indiana Business Types:</h2><h3 id=1-sole-proprietorship>1. Sole Proprietorship.</h3><p>A Sole Proprietorship is the simplest business structure as you are not required to file formation papers with the state. The business is owned and operated by one individual, with no legal distinction between the owner and the business entity. In Indiana, your business license requirements depend on your occupation and location.</p><h3 id=2-corporation>2. Corporation.</h3><p>A Corporation, owned by multiple shareholders, is a formal business structure that needs to be filed with the state. The business is authorized to act as a single entity and is recognized as such in law, meaning that shareholders are not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business.</p><h3 id=3-limited-liability-company>3. Limited Liability Company.</h3><p>A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is the most common business structure. It separates the owner/s and the company from a business and liability perspective. An LLC is the best option for a small business as it is flexible, easy to set up, and requires minimal paperwork. Although not required by law, an LLC should operate under an Operating Agreement in Indiana.</p><h3 id=4-general-partnership>4. General Partnership.</h3><p>A General Partnership (GP) is run by at least one general partner and one limited partner who manage the day-to-day business operations and are personally liable for all of the company's debts and obligations. This is the simplest form of a partnership with minimal paperwork. In Indiana, partnerships should operate under a written Partnership Agreement to avoid future problems.</p><h3 id=5-limited-partnership>5. Limited Partnership.</h3><p>A Limited Partnership (LP) is similar to a General Partnership except that limited partners do not manage the business and are only liable for the amount they invest in the company. To form an LP, you must have a registered agent and file a Certificate of Formation with the state.</p><h3 id=6-limited-liability-partnership>6. Limited Liability Partnership.</h3><p>A Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is similar to a General Partnership but each partner is protected from other partners' debts and obligations. To operate as an LLP, the business must be filed with the Secretary of State.</p><h3 id=7-nonprofit-corporation>7. Nonprofit Corporation.</h3><p>A nonprofit corporation engages in activities that do not provide financial gain for its members. This type of business structure must obtain nonprofit or tax-exempt status from the IRS and the Indiana Department of Revenue to be free from certain tax burdens.</p></div></div></div></div><div
