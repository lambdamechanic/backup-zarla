class="block block-callout primary"><h2 id=montana-business-types>Montana Business Types:</h2><h3 id=1-sole-proprietorship>1. Sole Proprietorship.</h3><p>Montana's sole proprietorship is the simplest business structure. Owned and managed by one individual, with no legal difference between the owner and the business entity, the owner of a sole proprietorship is responsible for all business profits, taxes, and liabilities.</p><p>In Montana, there are no filing requirements for starting a sole proprietorship, except for the Registration of Assumed Business Name if the business is operated under a business name that is not the owner's legal name.</p><h3 id=2-limited-liability-company>2. Limited Liability Company (LLC).</h3><p>An LLC is one of the most popular legal business structures. It separates the owner/s from the company from a financial and legal perspective. For small business owners, an LLC business structure is a great option as it's simple to set up and manage, with minimal paperwork.</p><p>In addition, this structure is beneficial during tax season, as LLC owners are not required to file a corporate tax return. LLCs must file Articles of Organization with the Montana Secretary of State.</p><h3 id=3-corporation>3. Corporation.</h3><p>A corporation is a more complex business structure that exists as a separate legal entity with its own rights and liabilities. It has shareholders who invest in the business and therefore own a part of it and must hold annual meetings. Corporations are not subject to self-employment taxes on their income.</p><h3 id=4-partnership>4. Partnership.</h3><p>A Montana partnership is operated by two or more individuals who share management responsibilities, profits, and liabilities. General and limited partnerships are the most common and partnership agreements may be filed with the Secretary of State's Office. Partnerships are subject to self-employment tax on their income.</p></div><div
