There are four distinct categories of retail:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Store retailers</strong> include department stores, convenience stores, national and regional chains, and conventional supermarkets, etc. Think Walmart or Target. These types of stores use prominent merchandise displays and signage to advertise their most popular products. They sell both household and business items.</p></li><li><p><strong>Specialty retailers</strong> target niche markets and focus on specific product categories. They are considered product experts and sell a range of items within their product specialty, be it clothing, medical supplies, home decor, etc. Because they stock niche products, specialty retailers' inventory management is typically less cumbersome than most retailers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mail order retailers</strong> reach customers who are either unable to go shopping, live too far from a shop, or simply don't like the shopping experience. They send out informative catalogs and brochures advertising a broad range of products.</p></li><li><p><strong>Online retailers</strong> cater to customers who want convenience in their shopping experience. Selling online means creating a shopping experience that is intuitive, reliable, and visually driven with detailed product descriptions and reviews. It should also have an easy ordering process and clear policies on warranties, returns, and refunds.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div

class="block"><h2 id=understanding-inventory-key-formulas-and-metrics>Understanding Inventory: Key Formulas and Metrics</h2><p>There are a number of key inventory metrics that can help increase the profitability of your retail store. Inventory, when not carefully managed, can lead to a loss of profits. The following formulas and calculations will help you optimize your inventory management to prevent that from happening.</p><p><strong>Average Inventory at Cost</strong> is the cost value of the inventory that you keep for a given period (typically a year). If your average inventory is higher than your sales, you will incur excessive inventory costs and be forced to sell at markdown prices.</p><p><strong>Average Inventory at Cost:</strong> The sum of end-of-month inventory for 12 consecutive months, divided by 12.</p><p><strong>Turnover Rate</strong> is the number of times in a year your total inventory is sold or the average number of months it takes for your inventory to be sold. A high turnover rate means you need to spend less to generate the same sales.</p><p><strong>Turnover Rate:</strong> Cost of goods sold for the year, divided by average inventory at cost.</p><p><strong>Gross Margin Return on Investment</strong> tells you how much of gross profit dollars you receive for every dollar invested in inventory. If your value is 1.5, it means that for every dollar you invest in inventory, you get $1.50 in gross profits back. Anything below 2 is excellent, while a value below 1 is considered poor.</p><p><strong>Gross Margin Return on Investment:</strong> Annual gross profit dollars divided by average inventory at cost.</p><p><strong>The Open-to-Buy formula</strong> tells you how much inventory you can buy each month so that you can sell and not be overstocked, according to a specific turnover rate. It comes in two parts:</p><p><strong>Open-to-Buy (Planning) formula:</strong> Planned sales in cost dollars, plus desired ending inventory, minus beginning inventory, minus open orders.</p><p><strong>Open-to-Buy (Monitoring) formula:</strong> Beginning-of-month inventory at cost, plus month-to-date inventory receipts at cost, plus balance on order for the month at cost, minus month-to-date sales at cost, minus balance of month’s sales plan at cost.</p><p><strong>The Weeks of Supply calculation</strong> tells you how many weeks it will take to completely sell all your stock of certain merchandise. The formula relies on current on-hand inventory and projected sales per week.</p><p><strong>Weeks of Supply:</strong> Current on-hand, divided by projected weekly sales.</p></div><div
