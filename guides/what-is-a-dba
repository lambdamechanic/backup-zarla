class="block-intro-text"><p>DBA stands for "doing business as" and is referred to as a business's assumed, trade, or fictitious name. A business is required to file a DBA when they conduct business under a name that is different from their legal name or their business's legal, registered name.</p><p>You have the choice of selecting a business name or DBA name for your business if you're starting a sole proprietorship or partnership. Depending on the county, city, or state your business is based in, you may be required to register your fictitious name for the protection of customers conducting business with your company.</p></div></div></div></div><div

class="block block-callout primary"><h3 id=which-businesses-require-a-dba>Which Businesses Require a DBA?</h3><p><strong>Sole proprietorships</strong> and <strong>partnerships</strong> will be required to file a DBA if the business operates under a name that’s not the business owner's full, legal name, or their partner’s name. Sole proprietorships and partnerships are unincorporated, therefore they are not required to file entity formation papers, as well as a business entity name with the state.</p><p>However, corporations and limited liability companies still have the option of registering a DBA name, which allows them to do business under a name other than the name on their incorporation papers.</p><p>Generally, corporations or LLCs will register a DBA name when the business wants a different name for a specific product or service. This way the corporation or LLC won't need to form a new business just to operate under a different name.</p><p>For example, Jane's Beauty Inc. wants to operate under a different name for their new hair care product line, “Jane's Hair Care Shop.” By filing a DBA name, Jane can save money and time, which would have been spent on launching and registering a new business.</p></div><div
