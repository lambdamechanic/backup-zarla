This adds up to the total sales of $160,000.</p></li><li><p>Take the $160,000 total sales and subtract the associated variable costs, which for this example come to $100,000. This gives you a total contribution margin of $60,000.</p></li><li><p>Now, divide the $60,000 total contribution margin by the 10,000 books sold, and you have your contribution margin per book: $6.</p></li></ol><p>Each book you've sold has contributed $6 towards paying your fixed costs. If all your fixed costs have been paid, then each book is contributing $6 towards your profit.</p><p><strong>Key Terms:</strong></p><p>List price: The price on the cover of the book in the bookstore or online store.</p><p>Variable costs: Retailer discount, distribution, paper, printing, binding, cover design, cover art, line editing, copy editing, text design, layout, proofreading costs, marketing, and royalties.</p><p>Fixed costs: Rent, salaries, insurance, licenses, permits, property tax, utilities, etc.</p></div><div

And third, the strength of print.”</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Fiona McCrae, Graywolf Press</p></td><td><p>“Publishing is full of generalizations, but a lot of the larger houses really wouldn’t buy a book if they didn’t think they’d sell at least 15,000 copies of it. So there were are all of these interesting, challenging manuscripts that small presses could and still do pick up over here in the U.S. At a small press you could sometimes sell 5,000 copies of a given literary book, which can be enough to get you in the black if you’re paying a modest advance. And you believe in the work and hope it might break out in some way—winning a prize, for example; finding a wider audience.”</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Declan Spring, Editor, New Directions Publishing Company</p></td><td><p>"So you’re not looking for the next bestseller.
