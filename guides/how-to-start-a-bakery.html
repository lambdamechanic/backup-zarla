Owners can elect to pay personal income tax instead of corporate income tax.</li><li><strong>Corporation:</strong> A corporation is the most formal business structure.

If you are unable to fund the bakery on your own, you will need to take out a loan. The most common way to get funding for a bakery is by securing commercial and/or small business loans.</p><p><strong>Commercial loans</strong> can be applied for at any major or local bank. You will need a high credit score to qualify and will benefit by getting access to large amounts of capital at lower interest rates, although you may have to wait months before accessing funds.</p><p><strong>Small business loans</strong> are specifically meant to protect small businesses and provide them with startup capital. They are available to those with borderline credit and offer lower interest rates. They require collateral and the approval process may take longer than other loan types.</p></div></div><div

class="col-12 faq-item"><h3 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-open-a-bakery class="question">How much does it cost to open a bakery?</h3><div
class="answer"><p>Bakery startup costs can range anywhere from $2,000 to $50,000, depending on the type of bakery you wish to open. Wholesale bakeries cost significantly more than retail bakeries since they require larger locations and more equipment. Online bakeries are often operated from home and require very low startup costs.</p></div></div><div
class="col-12 faq-item"><h3 id=how-much-do-bakery-owners-make class="question">How much do bakery owners make?</h3><div
class="answer"><p>The owner of a small bakery can make approximately $18,000 to $57,000 per year. However, competition in the industry is fierce, so bakery owners should conduct thorough market research and plan their business activities carefully.</p></div></div><div
class="col-12 faq-item"><h3 id=can-you-sell-baked-goods-at-your-home class="question">Can you sell baked goods at your home?</h3><div
class="answer"><p>Yes. You can consider this if your startup capital is limited and obtaining a small business loan is difficult. You can keep costs low while establishing your bakery’s brand. Home bakeries usually specialize in variations of specific baked goods, such as muffins, cupcakes, and cookies.</p></div></div><div
