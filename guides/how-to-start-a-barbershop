class="block"><h2 id=barbershop-metrics-profit-per-cut>Barbershop Metrics: Profit Per Cut</h2><p>One of the most important barbershop metrics is <strong>Profit Per Cut</strong>. Essentially, profit per cut tells you how much the shop makes from every cut after expenses. <strong>To find this number</strong>, take the total number of sales, subtract the percentage you pay your barbers and other monthly expenses, and then divide the result by the number of cuts done in that month.</p><p>Let’s assume you charge <strong>$25 a cut</strong> and manage as a team to do <strong>2,400 cuts a month</strong>. And, having a <strong>70/30 split</strong> between barbers and shop, you <strong>pay barbers 70% of earnings</strong>. Lastly, let’s put your <strong>monthly expenses (rent, supplies, utilities, etc.) at $4,000</strong>. Now we have the figures we need to calculate our profit per cut.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Calculate the total sales. Multiply the number of cuts done by the price of each cut.</strong></p><p>2,400 x $25 = $60,000.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Calculate the total barbers’ pay.</strong></p><p>$60,000 x 0.7 = $42,000.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Subtract barbers’ pay from total sales.</strong></p><p>$60,000 - $42,000 = $18,000.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Subtract monthly expenses.</strong></p><p>$18,000 - $4,000 = $14,000.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Divide this total profit by the number of cuts done that month.</strong></p><p>$14,000 / 2,400 = $5.83.</p><p>As you can see, $5.83 is your profit per $25-cut.</p></div><div
