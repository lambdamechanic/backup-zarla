class="block"><h2 id=coffee-shop-metrics-cost-per-item-sold>Coffee Shop Metrics: Cost Per Item Sold</h2><h4>Coffee:</h4><p>A simple drink of coffee will require a range of ingredients. Let's assume milk costs .234 cents per ounce, and a coffee drink requires 9 ounces of milk, your milk cost will then be .211 cents.</p><p><strong>.234 cents x 9 ounces = .211 cents.</strong></p><p>If you're interested in adding espresso, you will need one double shot. One pound of beans is able to produce 32 double shots. If it costs $7.50 for a pound of beans, the coffee cost will be .234 cents.</p><p>To add 1.25 ounces of syrup, which costs $4.50 for a 25.4-ounce bottle, it will cost .221 cents.</p><p><strong>.211 cents + .234 cents + .221 cents = .666 cents</strong></p><p><strong>It's important to note that cups, lids, and sleeves add additional cost</strong>. If they all add up to .20 cents, the total cost of the coffee drink would be <strong>.866 cents.</strong></p><h4>Cake:</h4><p>If you plan on baking and selling your own baked goods, there are many variable costs to consider as well. To make a simple cake, you will need flour, sugar, eggs, milk, etc. These raw materials can cost anywhere between $5.00 and $500.00, depending on how many cakes you plan on producing on a daily or weekly basis.</p><p>If we assume a cake recipe needs 16 ounces of milk, divide a gallon's 128 ounces by 16 to calculate 8 batches. If a gallon of milk costs $5.00, divide by 8 to calculate .62 cents per batch for that one ingredient.</p><p>You will need to repeat this calculation for each ingredient to calculate the total cost of ingredients for a recipe. Divide the total cost by the number of servings the recipe was made for. If your recipe totaled $4.00 in ingredients and made 12 servings, you will need to divide $4.00 by 12 to calculate a per-serving cost of .33 cents.</p><p>Please note, you will need to include other costs, such as equipment, supplies, labor, and operating costs.</p></div><div
