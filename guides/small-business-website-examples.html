<span>San Francisco, California, U.S.</span></p><div
class="entry-text"><p>The Mill, a coffee shop in San Francisco, California, is a result of a collaboration between two small businesses: Josey Baker Bread and Four Barrel Coffee. I found that The Mill's website skillfully merges the shared vision of both brands by integrating quotes and images that showcase their promise of excellence.</p><p>The website opened with an immersive hero image of the bakery's storefront, instantly transporting me into its virtual space. It continued with high-quality images and graphics that gave the website a fresh feel. I particularly liked the content-heavy footer menu, which conveniently listed the store's operating hours and email address.</p></div><h4>Pros and Cons</h4><div

</span><div
class="entry-text"><p>The home page really caught my eye — it's visually stunning, with polished images that made me crave a visit to my nearest coffee shop. Navigation was seamless thanks to the floating menu and back-to-top button. Plus, I found the interactive map in the footer menu super helpful as it allowed me to pinpoint the store's exact location in seconds.</p></div></div><div

<img
src="/assets/images/icon-minus.svg" alt="minus sign" width="18" height="18" />
</span><div
class="entry-text"><p>I found the website filled with valuable information about The Mill, but I couldn't find an "About" page, so I had to learn more about Josey Baker Bread and Four Barrel Coffee's partnership through their respective websites. Also, as confirmed by WAVE, the main menu lacked contrast against the hero image, which caused me to overlook it initially.</p></div></div></div><h4>Desktop Review</h4><div

class="entry-text"><p>The home page's full-screen images felt more impactful on the desktop site, which followed a parallax scrolling design that was both memorable and visually captivating. However, the lack of hover-activated functions made the browsing experience feel monotonous. I found myself wishing for more engaging content, like customer reviews, an "About" section, or multimedia elements, to hold my interest longer.</p><p>On Google's PageSpeed Insights, the desktop site produced excellent results, including 96/100 for best practices and 86/100 for accessibility. More impressively, the site scored 94/100 for its overall performance.</p></div></div><h4>Mobile Review</h4><div

Surprisingly, this benefited the site, as the main menu and company name stood out more distinctly against the lighter background. Unlike my experience with the desktop site, where I found myself gravitating toward the footer menu, this higher contrast drew me in faster, encouraging me to interact with the top menu.</p><p>Moreover, the back-to-top button was more noticeable on the mobile site, and it helped streamline navigation. While I enjoyed the user-friendly experience of the mobile site, it scored a modest 46/100 for overall performance on PageSpeed Insights.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div

<span>Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada</span></p><div
class="entry-text"><p>Founded in 2018, The Tare Shop is a zero-waste bulk store and café located in Nova Scotia, Canada. I was impressed by the store's spacious website, which boasts a neatly organized layout that's packed with notable features, including a floating menu, a currency converter, and a trackable shopping cart.</p><p>Upon arrival, I was captivated by a full-screen hero image that championed the shop's commitment to sustainability. This was cleverly followed by the store's latest impact report and blog, engaging me from the outset. Plus, the main menu included links to an events page, allowing me to stay informed about their upcoming events.</p></div><h4>Pros and Cons</h4><div

<span
class="icon icon-sm">
<img
src="/assets/images/icon-plus.svg" alt="plus sign" width="18" height="18" />
</span><div
class="entry-text"><p>When I entered The Tare Shop's website, a newsletter sign-up form popped up with a discount promise, immediately enticing me with a reward, while a floating menu ensured my navigation remained swift and smooth. A currency converter was available for diverse audiences, and the payment options were conveniently visible in the footer menu.</p></div></div><div
class="entry-website-cons">
<span
class="icon icon-sm">
<img
src="/assets/images/icon-minus.svg" alt="minus sign" width="18" height="18" />
</span><div
class="entry-text"><p>The store's vital details, such as operating hours and address, are relegated to the footer menu. If I were a customer who preferred quick results, this information would be more beneficial at the top of the home page. As identified by WAVE, the low contrast of the various icons made them hard to read, and there were missing alternative texts.</p></div></div></div><h4>Desktop Review</h4><div

class="entry-text"><p>The desktop website offered a clean layout with interesting touches that made navigating a breeze. While they've tucked the main menu behind a hamburger icon, which was a bit unusual for desktop websites, it did well to clean up the top of the home page. This setup also allowed the currency converter, shopping cart, and account access icons to stand out.</p><p>The Instagram feed toward the bottom of the page looked great on a desktop screen, but I felt like it missed some of the interactive features found on the mobile site. Thankfully, the website included hover-activated functions to keep things fun and engaging.</p></div></div><h4>Mobile Review</h4><div

While the main menu stayed tucked behind a neat hamburger icon, its floating function felt perfectly suited for the mobile site. Unlike the desktop version, the Instagram feed was presented as a banner, which was a nice touch since it encouraged me to interact and explore further.</p><p>Moreover, adding a rotating function to the top notification bar immediately caught my eye, bringing more attention to the message. Despite real-world tests proving pleasant, the mobile site scored 40/100 for performance on PageSpeed. However, it received 89/100 for accessibility and 96/100 for best practices.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div

class="entry-text"><p>Me&amp;B is a South African-based fashion brand launched in 2018. The brand is helmed by Betina and Kelly, the mother-daughter duo with a knack for all things colorful, alongside a small team of dedicated staff who were playfully introduced on the "MEET THE TEAM" page of their website — an element that drew me in and made me feel connected to their journey.</p><p>The home page placed plenty of emphasis on the online store's capabilities, which made it feel more geared toward established customers. However, the categories were clear and easy to navigate, and I appreciated the floating WhatsApp icon and the quick access to customer reviews.</p></div><h4>Pros and Cons</h4><div

class="entry-text"><p>The site's unclear narrative made me feel overwhelmed and detached from the brand, especially since important pages, like the "MEET THE TEAM" and "BLOG" pages, were pushed to the footer menu. This may not suit customers who prefer a personal touch. Moreover, WAVE flagged several contrast issues and empty links, adding to usability concerns.</p></div></div></div><h4>Desktop Review</h4><div

<span>Los Angeles, California, U.S.</span></p><div
class="entry-text"><p>Known for its innovative beers and community-focused ethos, Eagle Rock Brewery is a respected craft microbrewery in Los Angeles, California. Founded in 2009, the brewery boasts an impactful website that embraces the "less is more" philosophy. After verifying that I was of legal drinking age, the site opened with a vivid graphic as a hero image, followed by concise information about the brewery's taproom hours and contact details.</p><p>This clear and engaging introduction immediately drew me in, making it easier to find essential information. While the single-page design also helped streamline navigation, the main menu provided swift access to the brewery's newsletter, seasonal or specialty beers, and FAQs.</p></div><h4>Pros and Cons</h4><div

class="entry-text"><p>The hero image, which served as the primary visual entertainment of the home page, was compelling from the outset, providing insight into the brewery's branding and founding date. The footer menu ensured I always knew the taproom's details, and I appreciated the easy access to the newsletter and FAQ pages. Moreover, WAVE only found two contrast errors.</p></div></div><div

The lack of personal images and trust elements made me feel detached from the brand. Additionally, the online store is not fully operational, and the small social media icons are easily missed.</p></div></div></div><h4>Desktop Review</h4><div

class="entry-text"><p>Facetheory, a sustainable skincare brand launched in 2014, immediately enchanted me with its modern website, which seamlessly blended the hues of its logo into the overall layout, resulting in a neat and cohesive online space. Navigational titles and CTAs stood out like beacons, guiding me effortlessly through a home page alive with fun designs, interactive graphics, and staged images.</p><p>The site's more advanced features, such as the skin quiz and the "Build Your Bundle" option, helped set the brand and website apart. I also enjoyed the convenient floating menu, the before and after images, and the notification bar's access to thousands of reviews.</p></div><h4>Pros and Cons</h4><div
