class="block"><h2 id=rhode-island-business-structures>Rhode Island Business Structures:</h2><h3 id=1-sole-proprietorship>1. Sole Proprietorship.</h3><p>A sole proprietorship is the simplest business structure. The business is owned and operated by one individual who receives all profits and is personally liable for all the debts of the business.</p><h3 id=2-general-partnership>2. General Partnership.</h3><p>A general partnership is run by at least one general partner and one limited partner. These partners manage the day-to-day business operations and are personally liable for all of the company's debts. This is the simplest form of a partnership with minimal paperwork.</p><h3 id=3-benefit-corporation>3. Benefit Corporation.</h3><p>A benefit corporation is run by one or more owners/shareholders and has a board of directors. Benefit corporations differ from regular corporations in that they consider the environment and society in addition to seeking profit. Shareholders have limited liability for the debts of the business.</p><h3 id=4-workers-cooperative>4. Workers' Cooperative.</h3><p>A workers' cooperative is owned and managed by the workers of a business. The members share the decision-making and profits of the business. The benefits of this type of business structure are that it provides better wages, offers extensive training for employees, as well as opportunities for participation in management.</p><h3 id=5-corporation>5. Corporation.</h3><p>A Corporation is a formal business structure with unlimited shareholders. The business is authorized to act as a single entity and is recognized as such in law, meaning that the owners are not personally liable for the debts of the business. A corporation is costly to set up and has a lot of paperwork.</p><h3 id=6-limited-liability-company>6. Limited Liability Company.</h3><p>A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is the most common business structure. It separates the owner/s and the company from a business and liability perspective. An LLC is the best option for a small business as it is flexible, easy to set up, and requires minimal paperwork.</p><h3 id=7-limited-partnership>7. Limited Partnership.</h3><p>A Limited Partnership (LP) is similar to a General Partnership except that limited partners do not manage the business and are only liable for the amount they invest in the company.</p><h3 id=8-limited-liability-partnership>8. Limited Liability Partnership.</h3><p>A Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is similar to a General Partnership but each partner is protected from other partners' debts and obligations.</p><h3 id=9-nonprofit-corporation>9. Nonprofit Corporation.</h3><p>A nonprofit corporation has no owners. Instead, it is governed by a board of directors. Nonprofit corporations are funded by grants, public donations, and fees for services. All funds are retained by the organization for the advancement of a social cause.</p></div></div></div></div><div
