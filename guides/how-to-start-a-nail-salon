For example, if you're targeting busy female professionals, you could provide a mobile service by traveling to clients' homes or places of work. Alternatively,  you could lease a space inside a business park.</p><p><strong>Research potential zoning restrictions.</strong> Regardless of whether you're opening a home-based or retail nail salon, be sure to check what commercial activities your city or county allows in your neighborhood to avoid violating any zoning regulations.</p><p><strong>Consider the cost of opening a retail location.</strong> A retail nail salon will cost between $40,000 and $125,000 to build from the ground up. The most economical option is to rent retail space, such as a former hair salon or restaurant, that already comes equipped with power and water.</p><p><strong>Be mindful of standard nail salon sizes and dimensions.</strong> The size of an average nail salon is 1,000â€“1,500 square feet. The area size of a manicure station is roughly 16 square feet, with the space required for a pedicure being double the size at 32 square feet. Your retail and reception area will fit into roughly 100 square feet. This means you'll be able to fit 10â€“12 nail technicians into an average size nail salon.
