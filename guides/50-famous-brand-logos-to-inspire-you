Nike.</h3><p>An ambitious sports apparel company needed a logo that projected speed and glory. It drew inspiration from the wings of the Greek goddess of victory, Nike. The swoosh shape of the Nike logo encourages movement and speed, and its streamlined design promises activewear that makes you faster and stronger. This logo appeals to its target market.</p><p>Geometric simplicity allows the Nike logo to be recognizable on any medium, be it on the side of a shoe or a billboard in Times Square.</p><p><strong>Variations of the Nike logo:</strong></p></div><div

class="block"><h3 id=2-apple>2. Apple.</h3><p>The Apple logo is a great example of brand identity embodied by visual design. Apple wanted to position itself as distinct from the bland technology brands of the 90s, be they Microsoft or IBM.</p><p>Their new approach emphasized technological aesthetics as much as technological performance. They wanted to make their products desirable, so they used the biblical “bite of the apple” to express both desire and empowerment.</p><p>The principle of simplicity is applied to great effect. The bite could easily have left teeth marks, but Apple favored simple, minimalist linework that is more visually pleasing and uncomplicated, making it an instantly recognizable logo.</p><p><strong>Variations of the Apple logo:</strong></p></div><div

Created to reflect the initials of her name, the logo combines geometric, clean lines that form a subtle oval shape denoting the timelessness of the brand.</p><p>When added to the logo, the company name appears in a traditional-looking, custom sans serif typeface called Chanel. The logo remains monochromatic, featuring only black and white, echoing themes of longevity, power, and beauty.</p><p><strong>Variations of the Chanel logo:</strong></p></div><div

class="block"><h3 id=9-mercedes-benz>9. Mercedes Benz.</h3><p>Some logos tell a story, and that is certainly true of Mercedes Benz’s three-pointed star. Each point of the star represents a landscape upon which their vehicles operate: land, air, and sea.</p><p>Another story says that Gottlieb Daimler, one of the company’s founders, marked his house with a three-pointed star on a postcard to his sons, hoping that one day the star would bring prosperity to his factory. Crafting such rich lore around your logo creates deep emotional connections with your brand and makes it memorable to consumers.</p><p>An earlier version of the logo had the three-pointed star encased in a laurel wreath. The wreath gave a sense of prestige to the design, but it was later dropped in favor of simple geometric lines that are more recognizable. Its silver color bathes it in luxury and denotes a premium brand.</p><p><strong>Variations of the Mercedes Benz logo:</strong></p></div><div

class="block"><h3 id=22-starbucks>22. Starbucks.</h3><p>A logo with a seafaring theme is hardly appropriate for a coffee shop, yet the Starbucks logo is one of the most recognizable of all time. How did that happen?</p><p>Some argue that the logo’s nautical imagery points to coffee’s history at sea, as traders from all around the world brought the magical beans to western shores. Others say that the nautical theme is a homage to the city of Seattle.</p><p>Branding a business around a city is a great idea, as it transfers the qualities of that city to your brand, similar to BMW and Bavaria. Starbucks thus becomes synonymous with the coastal city of Seattle and takes on a new life as a proud representative of the city.</p><p>An interesting point about the Starbucks logo is that it defies conventional design principles of geometric simplicity in favor of a detailed design. This approach only works if you want your logo to be intriguing. The busy icon of a siren compels viewers to engage with it and ponder its meaning.</p><p><strong>Variations of the Starbucks logo:</strong></p></div><div

The icon works better than the word in saying “find what you’re looking for at our stores,” and has become an emblem for the company.</p><p>Minimalist shapes and clean designs are easier to spot and remember, while circles are visually interesting shapes that hold attention and convey ideas of harmony and balance.

The beauty of tying emotion to a symbol is that he need only display it to communicate exactly what he wants, with simple visuals.</p><p>The current version of the Batman logo is a prime example of the power of simplicity. A simple, minimalist outline of a bat, without detail, is more recognizable than an anatomically accurate depiction with fangs and claws, while its singular black color is apt and helps induce feelings of fear.</p><p>This strategy need not be confined to the comic book world.

class="block"><h3 id=38-national-geographic>38. National Geographic.</h3><p>Before National Geographic was a television channel, they were a magazine. They were famous for their reporting on natural science, history, and culture, but especially for their award-winning wildlife and nature photography. The yellow portrait frame thus came to symbolize exquisite photography and the pages of a magazine.</p><p>Yellow symbolizes sunshine or the sunlit plains of the savannah, signaling National Geographic’s breadth of coverage and establishing a link with nature. The yellow color pops against the black background, as does the business name in white, giving it salience. This simple design is versatile and highly recognizable.</p><p>The use of a modern, sans-serif typeface coincided with a shift to the era of digital media. This gave the logo a fresh and modern feel that was fitting for a brand that now existed across multiple media formats, and its size in the logo gave power and respect to the business name.</p><p><strong>Variations of the National Geographic logo:</strong></p></div><div

Audi.</h3><p>The Audi logo is another great example where iconography, when done right, warrants the exclusion of a business name.</p><p>The icon features four interlocking rings that represent the union of the four manufacturing companies into the one company that became Audi. The icon symbolizes strength through unity and cooperation, while circles also demonstrate the perpetual cycle of innovation and engineering.</p><p>The simplicity of the design has made it one of the most popular car logos around. People see the four rings and associate them with technological supremacy, attention to detail, and beauty.

Thirdly, the arrow symbolizes movement and efficiency, suiting a company that prides itself on its speedy deliveries.</p><p>Contrast is a useful tool for holding attention. The Amazon logo features the colors of black and orange, with black expressing premium quality and orange symbolizing energy and excitement.

The letter “U” represents the company and acts as an emblem. Inside the letter are 25 different objects that symbolize sustainable living.</p><p>The beauty of this design is in the boundary the letter “U” creates. It allows for creative expression and detail, but confines it to the boundaries of the “U,” making a design that is both clean and detailed at the same time. Some of the objects inside the letter are a bee, a spoon, and a strand of hair.</p><p>Some argue that each object correlates with a brand that falls under the Unilever umbrella, as the company owns hundreds of brands, including beauty brands, nutritional brands, and more.</p><p><strong>Variations of the Unilever logo:</strong></p></div><div
