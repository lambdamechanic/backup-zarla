To break into this competitive market, it’s important to think about your niche and brand identity.</p><p><strong>Niche</strong> -  Choosing a niche is one of the most important aspects of starting a T-shirt business as you’ll want your product to stand out from your competitors'. Think about who your ideal customer is, the style of T-shirts you plan on producing, and how you will convince them to buy your product.</p><p><strong>Design</strong> - If you’re a graphic designer or artist, you probably have a portfolio of designs that would look cool on a T-shirt. But if you’re not, keep in mind that your designs do not have to be overly complicated. Simple designs work too.</p><p>If you'd like, you could hire a graphic designer to create designs for you, purchase pre-made designs from sites like Dribbble, or sign up for a T-shirt design course on Skillshare and create your own design(s).</p><p><strong>Brand</strong> - A strong brand identity is vital in a saturated market such as the T-shirt industry. That’s why building a distinctive brand that attracts customers is so important. Your T-shirt brand will rely on your niche, design, quality, and marketing efforts.</p><div

A mesh stencil (one for each color) is used to transfer ink by passing a squeegee over the mesh, which pushes the ink through the holes and onto the T-shirt.</p><p><strong>Screen printing creates vibrant designs and various effects can be achieved with some skill</strong>. It is also more cost-effective to print in bulk (25 or more T-shirts).</p><p>If you’re planning on doing it by yourself, keep in mind that it will take time to learn and perfect. Alternatively, you could send your T-shirts off to a professional screen printer.</p><h4>Heat Transfer:</h4><p>Heat transfer printing, also known as thermal printing, uses a heat press machine to transfer an image from a wax-based ink ribbon onto a surface.</p><p>During thermal printing, the wax ribbon is pressed against the T-shirt and the opposite side is heated until the ink melts and transfers onto the fabric.</p><p><strong>This technique allows you to print high quality, photorealistic images.</strong> It's also ideal for smaller orders and can be set up at home.</p><p>On the flip side, heat transfer printing requires a large initial investment for machinery, and prints are not as durable as with other printing techniques.</p><h4>Direct-to-Garment (DTG) printing:</h4><p>With the advent of digital printing, more people are switching to the direct-to-garment method due to its cost-effectiveness and ease of use.</p><p>Similar to an inkjet printer, a DTG machine prints the design directly onto the T-shirt. The ink is then heat set with a tunnel dryer.</p><p><strong>DTG printing is fast and accurate, and renders photorealistic prints in unlimited colors.</strong> However, it is not cost-effective for bulk orders and does not print well on darker garments.</p><div

You'll want to consider what price you can afford to sell at to make a profit, and how much customers are willing to spend, coupled with your material, labor, and shipping costs.</p><p>Your pricing structure will also depend on the type of T-shirt designs that will be printed. For example, basic designs such as a simple slogan or image will cost less to make than a highly-detailed image.</p><p><strong>On average, fast fashion T-shirts range from $5.00 to $15.00 a piece.</strong> These T-shirts typically feature a simple design with or without a few words and are best for selling in bulk to retail stores and boutiques. By selling larger quantities, your cost per unit will drop.</p><p><strong>Mid-range T-shirts are sold for around $16.00 to $27.00.</strong> This price point is usually set for T-shirts from popular brand names. If you are able to place small wholesale orders, your profit margin will be decent.</p><p><strong>Band T-shirts and high-detail, graphic T-shirts retail for around $28.00 to $40.00 per item.</strong> These tees are usually of a higher quality than your average mass-market tees and are favored by streetwear labels, boutiques, and customers looking for specific or unusual designs.</p><p><strong>Luxury T-shirts range from $41.00 to $80.00 or more and are typically associated with luxury brands.</strong> These labels are often endorsed by celebrities, which pushes up the retail price.</p><p>It's important to note that your selling or wholesale price would work out to around half the retail price, which you need to factor in accordingly. However, each business is unique, therefore the pricing formula you choose will ultimately depend on your financial situation.</p></div></div></div><div

A mesh stencil (one for each color) is used to transfer ink by passing a squeegee over the mesh, which pushes the ink through the holes and onto the T-shirt.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Screen printing creates vibrant designs and various effects can be achieved with some skill<\/strong>. It is also more cost-effective to print in bulk (25 or more T-shirts). <\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re planning on doing it by yourself, keep in mind that it will take time to learn and perfect. Alternatively, you could send your T-shirts off to a professional screen printer.<\/p>\n<h4>Heat Transfer:<\/h4>\n<p>Heat transfer printing, also known as thermal printing, uses a heat press machine to transfer an image from a wax-based ink ribbon onto a surface. <\/p>\n<p>During thermal printing, the wax ribbon is pressed against the T-shirt and the opposite side is heated until the ink melts and transfers onto the fabric.<\/p>\n<p><strong>This technique allows you to print high quality, photorealistic images.<\/strong> It's also ideal for smaller orders and can be set up at home. <\/p>\n<p>On the flip side, heat transfer printing requires a large initial investment for machinery, and prints are not as durable as with other printing techniques.<\/p>\n<h4>Direct-to-Garment (DTG) printing:<\/h4>\n<p>With the advent of digital printing, more people are switching to the direct-to-garment method due to its cost-effectiveness and ease of use. <\/p>\n<p>Similar to an inkjet printer, a DTG machine prints the design directly onto the T-shirt. The ink is then heat set with a tunnel dryer. <\/p>\n<p><strong>DTG printing is fast and accurate, and renders photorealistic prints in unlimited colors.<\/strong> However, it is not cost-effective for bulk orders and does not print well on darker garments.<\/p>\n","url":"https://www.notzarla.com/guides/how-to-start-a-t-shirt-business#how-to-start-a-t-shirt-business-section3-step1","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.notzarla.com/images/zarla-choose-a-printing-technique-288x288-20200811.jpeg?crop=1:1,smart&width=144&dpr=2","height":"288","width":"288"},"itemListElement":[{"@type":"HowToTip","text":"<p>If you're unsure about which printing technique to use, think about how durable you want your T-shirt designs to be, the cost of each printing method, and whether you'll be printing in bulk or only creating one-off designs.<\/p>\n"}]},{"@type":"HowToStep","position":"2","name":"<p>Create your own designs or buy pre-made designs.<\/p>\n","text":"<p>Search for trending topics on Google Trends and check out Reddit to find out what people are talking about and searching for.
