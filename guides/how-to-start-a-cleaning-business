When establishing your hourly rate, be sure to include your expertise and previous experience. In addition, your rate should largely depend on the size of the job.</p><p>For example, if you are expected to clean a commercial building, you need to consider the size of the building, the facilities you are expected to clean, and the time you need to finish the entire building. In these cases, opt for charging per square foot.</p></div></div></div><div

Meet with clients to discuss the job.</h3><p>For the first step, you want to determine the scope of the job. Meet with potential clients and discuss their expectations and job requirements. This will help you determine how much time, labor, cleaning services, and money is needed to complete the job. In addition, be sure to ask the client or company you're pitching to if they have a formal proposal process or request for proposal guidelines.</p><h3>2. Determine the costs of the job.</h3><p>You need to determine just how much it will cost you to finish the job so that you can charge the appropriate amount. Be sure to calculate your staffing, supplies, and transportation costs.</p><h3>3. Prepare a bid letter.</h3><p>A bid letter is a formal business proposal that outlines the specific duties that need to be performed and executed in order to complete the job. A bid letter should be well-crafted, detailed, and address the specific requirements and costs of the job. When complete, send the proposal to the client and follow-up with a phone call.</p></div></div></div></div><div
