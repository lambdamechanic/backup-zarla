This will also give you the opportunity to finance large purchases like equipment or machinery.</p><p>That being said, there is a downside to this option. Many credit cards with 0% APR periods charge balance transfer fees of between 3% and 5%. And, once the free period is over, you'll pay a variable APR of 12.74% to 25.74%. For this to work, it's essential that you pay down your debt as soon as possible.</p><p>Be sure to compare balance transfer cards to find the right option for your needs, and don't hesitate to speak to a financial consultant to help you make the right decision for your business.</p></div></div><div

Some of these lenders are known for loaning to applicants with lower credit scores and do not request collateral if the loan is under $100,000. However, interest rates can be higher than other loan options.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Microloans:<\/strong> microloans are small, short-term loans offered to small businesses and start-ups with low capital requirements.
