In order to legally operate your business, you will need to research and understand the state and local licensing laws that oversee lawn care businesses.</p><p><strong>Regulations that affect landscapers:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Fertilizers and pesticides</strong>: Part of the job includes working with many toxic chemicals, which can contaminate public water resources. Therefore local jurisdictions regulate the use of fertilizers and pesticides. You may need an additional license if you plan on using one of these.</p></li><li><p><strong>Irrigation</strong>: In some states, water is scarce. You might need to use different techniques that bring water to your customer's land. States, particularly in the American Southwest, regulate this kind of water transfer, so you will need to be familiar with local laws and permits.</p></li><li><p><strong>Waste removal</strong>: Your line of work can produce a large amount of waste in the form of extra dirt, grass clippings, branches, and other forms of waste. You will need to know how the local jurisdiction expects you to deal with this type of waste.</p></li></ul><div
