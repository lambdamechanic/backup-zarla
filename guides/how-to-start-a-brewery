</span><p>This is a busy market, so the competition analysis portion of your business plan is very important. There are likely already several craft breweries in your region, so you will need to understand what they are doing and how your plan is distinct. To simplify things, start by asking yourself, "Why would customers buy my beer instead of the beer from brewery XYZ down the road?"</p></div><div

Setting a brewery up as a sole proprietorship wouldn't make sense, because you will likely need employees and have a tax burden that is too large for one person to carry on their own. Most local breweries start as a limited liability company (LLC).</p><p>In an LLC, ownership is usually limited to just a few people. This could also be said of a partnership, except partners must each bear some responsibility for taxes on their individual tax returns. In an LLC, you are only taxed on income that comes out of the company. Thus, when you're opening a brewery and reinvesting most of your initial profits, the tax consequences will be very minimal.</p><p>A further benefit of setting up your new brewery as an LLC is that it gives you greater control over how the company operates. In a business that is very hands-on, this control is important if you want to be able to grow and adapt.</p><div

</span><p>You should be careful not to over-extend yourself. When you start a new brewery, it can be tempting to ramp up production in order to pay for all of the equipment that you've just purchased. On the other hand, it can be equally tempting to experiment with recipes and start with a small production volume. You need to strike a balance that addresses your cash flow needs and maintains the quality of the beer.</p></div><div

class="block"><h2 id=brewery-metrics-revenue-per-barrel>Brewery Metrics: Revenue Per Barrel</h2><p>One of the most important brewing production metrics is <strong>Revenue Per Barrel</strong>. Essentially, revenue per barrel tells you what your gross earnings per barrel are. <strong>To find this number, all you need to do is divide your total sales revenue by the total number of barrels sold.</strong></p><p>For example, if your gross sales are $500,000.00 and you've sold 1,000 barrels, your revenue per barrel is $500.00.</p><p><strong>$500,000 / 1,000 BBLs = $500/BBL</strong></p><p><strong>You can build on this metric to find out what your per-barrel profits are.</strong> Determine how much it cost you to brew all of the beer that earned you $500,000.00 in sales and subtract the total cost from the total revenue. Then all you need to do is divide the result by the number of barrels sold to find your profit per barrel. If your total costs were $150,000.00, it would look like this:</p><p>Step 1. <strong>$500,000 - $150,000 = $350,000</strong></p><p>Step 2. <strong>$350,000 / 1,000 BBLs = $350/BBL</strong></p><p>As you can see, the final result ($350/BBL) is your profit per barrel, or <strong>Margin per barrel</strong>, as it is sometimes called.</p></div><div
