Before you open your gym, start offering sessions as a personal trainer. This way, you can slowly build up a network of clients and gain credibility. As you work with clients and get to know more and more people, you will develop a group of committed customers who are likely to join your gym when it opens and refer all of their friends to you.</p><div

If you notice that your membership usage rates are low, you can implement new programs and incentives that encourage customers to visit your gym more frequently. The higher someone's usage rate is, the better their chances of renewing their membership are.</p><h3 id=how-to-calculate-membership-usage>How to calculate membership usage:</h3><p><strong>Total number of days member attends Ã· Total number of days in the same time period</strong></p><p><strong>For example</strong>, say that Ted, a member of XYZ Fitness Club, has been to the gym 174 days in the past year. There are 365 days in a year, so Ted's usage rate can be calculated like this:</p><p>174 Ã· 365 = 0.48</p><p>So, we can say that Ted's usage rate is 0.48 or 48%.</p><p>Once you've calculated the usage rate for each individual member, you can add them all up and divide by the total number of members to find the overall usage rate.</p></div></div></div></div><div
