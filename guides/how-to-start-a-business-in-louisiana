For example, if you are creating an LLC, Lousiana LLC naming rules require your business name to include the phrase "limited liability company" or the abbreviations "LLC" or "LC."</p><p>Once you've brainstormed some name ideas and tested your top choices, you'll need to verify that your preferred name is distinct from the names of other businesses already registered and available for you to use. Start by doing a <a
href="https://coraweb.sos.la.gov/commercialsearch/commercialsearch.aspx">state business name search</a> then perform a <a
href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/search">federal trademark search</a>.</p><p>Once you've made a final choice, you can reserve the name before registering your business under that name. A business name can be reserved for <strong>120 days.</strong> This costs $25.00 for an LLC. You can reserve your business name by mailing a <a
href="https://www.sos.la.gov/BusinessServices/FileBusinessDocuments/GetFormsAndFeeSchedule/Pages/default.aspx">name reservation</a> form or by going online to reserve at the <a
href="https://www.sos.la.gov/BusinessServices/FileBusinessDocuments/Pages/default.aspx">geauxBIZ website</a>.</p><div

class="block"><h2 id=louisiana-business-types>Louisiana Business Types:</h2><h3 id=1-sole-proprietorship>1. Sole proprietorship.</h3><p>In Louisiana, a sole proprietorship may be the easiest way to form a business as it can be operated without filing with the state. To operate under a name other than the owner’s name, a DBA must be filed. There is no legal difference between the owner and the business, which means that the owner’s personal assets are not protected.</p><h3 id=2-partnership>2. Partnership.</h3><p>A legal agreement between two or more individuals who share management and earnings.
A Louisiana partnership is different from a Louisiana sole proprietorship in that is comprises two or more people and a contract of partnership must be registered with the state. Otherwise, it is legally identical.</p><h3 id=3-limited-liability-partnership>3. Limited Liability Partnership.</h3><p>In some states, limited liability partnerships (LLP) can only be formed by professional service firms, such as a law firm. In Louisiana, any business can become an LLP. While partners are not protected from all business liabilities, they may not be personally liable for debts brought about by other partners' infractions or negligence.</p><h3 id=4-low-profit-limited-liability-company>4. Low-Profit Limited Liability Company.</h3><p>Louisiana is among the states in which businesses can form a low-profit limited liability company (L3C), which is suitable for for-profit business ventures that are primarily concerned with being socially beneficial. This business structure bridges the gap between nonprofit and for-profit ventures.</p><h3 id=5-limited-liability-company>5. Limited Liability Company.</h3><p>A Louisiana limited liability company (LLC) is operated as a sole proprietorship but affords the owner protection from liability. Louisiana LLCs can choose to be taxed as a corporation or opt for the pass-through tax structure of sole proprietorships and partnerships.</p><h3 id=6-corporation>6. Corporation.</h3><p>A Louisiana corporation is a formal structure that is recognized as an entity separate from the owners or shareholders, affording them liability protection. It is run by a group of officers known as the board of directors who are elected by the shareholders. This is the most complex business structure and is subject to double taxation.</p></div><div
