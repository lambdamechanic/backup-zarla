To check name availability, visit the SOS website and perform a <a
href="https://apps1.web.maine.gov/nei-sos-icrs/ICRS?MainPage=x">corporate entity name search</a>. You should also do a Google search to find out if any business is using the name and search the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) <a
href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/search">trademark database</a> to see if the name or a similar version has already been registered.</p><p>By filing an <a
href="https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/corp/index.html">Application for Reservation of Name</a> online with the Maine SOS, you can reserve an available business name for <strong>120 days</strong>.  If you wish to file offline, you can download the form and mail it to the SOS. Mailing information is available on the form. There is a $20.00 filing fee included.</p><p>If you want to operate your business under an assumed name (a name that differs from the legal name of the business), you must file a DBA. While Maine law does not require sole proprietorships and partnerships to file trade names at state level, it does require them to file with their local municipal clerks. To protect your trade name, you must file a trade or service mark with the Division of Corporations.</p><p>Legal entities can register a trade name or DBA by filing an <a
href="https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/forms/combo/ASUM%205.pdf">assumed name form</a> with the Division of Corporations. The filing fee for an assumed name is $125.00.</p><div

class="block block-callout primary"><h2 id=maine-business-types>Maine Business Types:</h2><h3 id=1-sole-proprietorship>1. Sole proprietorship.</h3><p>A sole proprietorship has no legal difference between the owner and the business and does not require filing with the state. While this is the easiest way of starting a small business in Maine, it does not protect the business owner's personal assets as he is fully liable for any business debts and losses.</p><h3 id=2-partnership>2. Partnership.</h3><p>A partnership is a legally binding agreement between two or more individuals. The partners share management duties and profits. Similar to a sole proprietorship, this business structure does not afford the owners protection from liabilities.</p><h3 id=3-limited-liability-company>3. Limited liability company.</h3><p>A limited liability company (LLC) is a hybrid business structure that offers limited liability to its owners. Includes certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership or sole proprietorship. An LLC may choose to use corporate tax rules instead of being treated as a partnership.</p><h3 id=4-corporation>4. Corporation.</h3><p>A corporation is a formal legal structure and a more complex way to organize a business. It is authorized to act as a single entity and is recognized as such by law. It affords the shareholders protection from liability and is usually managed by a board of directors elected by the shareholders.</p></div><div
